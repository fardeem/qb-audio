    "59": "But those who did wrongs straightway substituted\nwords in no way like what they had been told;\nSo We sent down from the sky\na staggering devastation on the wrongdoers,\nfor the godlessness they would not cease.",

    "61": "And remember when\nyou said to Moses,\n‘O Moses, never can we bear just one food,\nso call on your Lord,\nthat He bring forth for us\nfrom what the earth grows,\nits greens, long gourds, wheat, lentils, and onions.’\nHe said: ‘Do you eagerly seek what is worse\nin place of the better?\nGet you all down to a great city,\nand you are sure to have the pathetic things you have asked.’\nAnd fixed indelibly upon them\nwere humiliation and broken-spiritedness,\nand they came back having incurred utter wrath from Allah.\nThat was for their ever disbelieving in the wondrous verses and signs of Allah,\nand slaying the very prophets without right:\nAnd that in turn was for their disobeying,\nand transgression they would not end.",
    "62": "Verily those who have believed, and those of Jewry,\nthe Christians, the Sabaeans:\nwhoever will\nbelieve in Allah and the Last Day,\nand work righteousness,\nthey shall have their wage with their Lord,\nand need never be feared for,\nnor shall they grieve.",
    "63": "And remember when\nWe took solemn covenant of you,\nand raised up over you the very Mount of Sinai:\n‘Take firmly what We have bestowed on you\nand remember what is in it,\nthat haply you may be godfearing.’",
    "64": "And yet just after even that,\nyou turned wholly away.\nIf not for the pure largesse of Allah upon you\nand His mercy,\nyou had been of the entirely ruined.",
    "65": "You know very well\nthose of you who broke the Sabbath,\nand We said to them, ‘Be you apes, driven despised away.’",
    "66": "And We made it a shocking example\nto those dwelling around it,\nand all who came after it;\nAnd an impending warning to the godfearing.",
    "67": "And remember when Moses said to his people,\n‘Verily Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.’\nThey said, ‘Do you take us as a laughingstock?’\nHe said, ‘I seek refuge in Allah from\nbeing of utter fools.’",
    "68": "They said, ‘Pray to your Lord, and He shall make clear to us\nwhat it should be.’\nHe said, ‘Verily He says it shall be a cow\nneither past its years, nor tender in youth unmated, but between that;\nSo do as you are bid.’",
    "69": "They said, ‘Pray to your Lord, and He shall make clear to us\nwhat color it should be.’\nHe said, ‘Verily He says it is to be a gold cow\nbrilliant in color, admired by all who look.’",
    "70": "They said, ‘Pray to your Lord for us,\nand He shall make clear to us what it should be:\nVerily cows are all alike to us,\nand certainly, Allah willing, we shall be guided.’",
    "71": "He said, ‘Verily He says\nit should not be a cow so servilely low that it\nthrows up dust behind a plow,\nor waters tillage;\nFree of any blemish;\nWith no other patch of color in it.’\nThey said, ‘Now you have brought the whole truth.’\nAnd so they slaughtered it,\nwhile they almost would not.",
    "72": "And when you took an innocent life,\nand all wholly denied it and accused each other;\nWhile Allah was to bring forth\nwhat you kept concealed.",
    "73": "And We said, ‘Strike him with a piece of it’:\nEven thus does Allah raise the dead,\nand show you His incomparable signs,\nthat haply you may comprehend.",
    "74": "Yet after even that\nyour hearts grew hard again,\nso they are like stones or even worse:\nFor of stones is that from which rivers burst;\nAnd that which splits and water issues forth;\nAnd that which plummets down from the very dread of Allah:\nNor is Allah the least heedless of all you do.",
    "75": "Can you hope they will unwaveringly believe you all,\nwhen a faction of them used to hear the word of Allah,\nthen actually change it as soon as they had understood it,\nknowing full well?",
    "76": "And when they meet those who believe,\nthey say, ‘We believe.’\nAnd when back alone with themselves, their leaders say:\n‘Are you telling them what Allah\nhas divulged to you in your own scripture confirming their prophet,\nso they may make a case with it against you\nwhen you reach your Lord:\nCan you not even think?’",
    "77": "Can they really not know\nthat Allah knows all they conceal and all they reveal?",
    "78": "And some among them are unlettered,\nwho know the Book not,\nbut only vain hopes fabricated for them by their learned.\nThey nothing but surmise.",
    "79": "So woe to those who write the Book\nwith their own hands,\nand yet more outrageous in enormity, say over and over:\n‘This is from Allah Himself,’\nto buy a paltry price thereby.\nSo woe to them\nfrom what their hands have written,\nand woe to them\nfrom what they earn and earn.",
    "80": "And they have said:\n‘The hellfire shall never even touch us,\nsave a handful of days.’\nSay: ‘Have you taken a covenant from Allah Himself,\nfor Allah never breaks His word;\nOr do you utter against Allah\nwhat you know not?’",
    "81": "By no means!\nWhoever earns himself a monstrous ill deed,\nand is compassed round by his wrongdoing,\nthose are the denizens of hell,\nin it shall they abide.",
    "82": "And those who believe and work righteous deeds,\nthose are the dwellers of the lush-shaded grove of paradise,\nin it shall they abide.",
    "83": "And remember when We took the solemn covenant\nof the children of Israel:\n‘You shall worship naught but Allah,\nand show every kindness to parents,\nand to next of kin, orphans, and the unfortunate,\nand say gracious words to people,\nand perform the prayer, and give the due alms.’\nYet incredibly you turned away, breaking your word,\nsave very few of you indeed,\nwhile you have ever been averse.",
    "84": "And remember\nwhen We took your most solemn covenant:\n‘You shall not spill each other’s innocent blood,\nor drive one another from your habitations’;\nAnd yet more, you confirmed its bindingness on you,\nacknowledging it down through all the generations.",
    "85": "Yet incredibly, here you are, these very ones:\nIt is now you who slay each other in local battles,\nand drive out a party of your own selves from their very homes,\nleaguing yourselves with one or the other gentile tribes against them\nin whole sin and transgression;\nAnd when they reach you as lowly captives therefrom,\nyou “charitably” ransom them—while the very expelling of them\nwas unlawful for you!\nSo do you believe in part of the Book,\nand disbelieve in part?\nThen what may be the requital of whoever of you does that,\nbut abject humiliation in this world,\nand on the Day of Resurrection,\nthey shall be taken forcibly back to the most unsparing chastisement;\nNor is Allah the least heedless\nof aught you do.",
    "86": "Those are who have eagerly purchased the life of this world\nwith the life of the next:\nSo the chastisement shall not be lightened from them,\nnor shall they be helped.",
    "87": "Verily did We give Moses the Book,\nand made follow in his footsteps\nso many other messengers;\nAnd bestowed Jesus son of Mary wondrous manifest proofs,\nand succored him with the Purest Angelic Spirit.\nSo did you, whenever a messenger brought you\nwhat your hearts did not care for,\nshow haughty disdain;\nso that one party you cried lies to,\nand another you would actually slay?",
    "88": "And they say:\n‘Our hearts are innately encased shut from your message.’\nRather has Allah cursed them for their unbelief;\nSo little do any of them believe at all!",
    "89": "And when a mighty Book came to them\nfrom Allah Himself,\nconfirming what they already possessed,\n—while just before they had been praying to Allah\nfor triumph over unbelievers through the coming prophet—\nSo no sooner had there come to them what they knew full well,\nthan they disbelieved in it!\nSo the curse of Allah be on unbelievers.",
    "90": "How evil a price indeed\nis what they have paid to gratify their selfish souls:\nDisbelief in what Allah has sent down,\nout of arrogant vile envy transgressing all bounds,\nsimply because Allah is sending down of His bounteous favor\nupon whom He wills of His servants:\nSo they came back having incurred utter divine wrath,\non top of the utter divine wrath already on them;\nAnd unbelievers shall have a humiliating chastisement.",
    "91": "And when they are told,\n‘Believe in what Allah has sent down,’\nthey say, ‘We shall believe but in what was sent down to us,’\nwhile they disbelieve in anything beyond it,\nwhen it is the Truth confirming what they already possess.\nSay, ‘Then why have you slain so many\nof the prophets of Allah time after time before,\nif believers are what you be?’",
    "92": "Verily Moses had come to you with wondrous clear proofs,\nyet astoundingly you took the calf,\njust after he had gone,\ncommitting appalling idolatrous wrong.",
    "93": "And remember\nwhen We took solemn covenant of you,\nand raised up over you the very Mount of Sinai:\n‘Take firmly what We have bestowed on you,\nand hearken.’\nThey said: ‘We hear’ and ‘We disobey’:\nso their hearts became drunk full with adoration of the calf,\nfor their unbelief.\nSay, ‘How evil a thing indeed\nis that which this faith of yours commands you,\nif believers are what you be.’",
    "94": "Say, ‘If you alone shall have the Final Abode\nreserved by Allah,\nand none else of mankind,\nthen long for death if you be telling the truth.’",
    "95": "And never shall they long for it, ever,\nbecause of what their hands have sent ahead,\nand Allah well knows\nthe wrongdoers.",
    "96": "And you will always find them\nthe most grasping of all mankind\nfor any last pathetic shred of life,\neven more than idolaters.\nAny of them burningly wishes if only\nhe could have his life prolonged beyond others\nby a thousand dreary years;\nWhile it shall not wrest him from the grip of the chastisement\nto have his life made long;\nAnd Allah sees all they do.",
    "97": "Say: ‘Whoever is a rank enemy to Gabriel,\n—for verily it is he who has brought it down upon your heart\nby the leave of Allah,\nconfirming what came before it\nand as an incomparable guidance and joyous tiding\nto all who submit in faith’—",
    "98": "Whoever is an enemy of Allah\nand His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael:\nVerily Allah is a dire enemy\nto unbelievers.",
    "99": "And verily have We sent down to you\nmighty verses unmistakably clear in authority;\nWhile none disbelieves in them but the godlessly wicked.",
    "100": "Then whenever they have made a solemn covenant:\nCan a faction of them have actually flung it aside forgotten?\nNo, but even worse; Most of them will never believe.",
    "101": "And when a momentous messenger reached them\nfrom Allah Himself,\nconfirming all they already possessed,\na faction of those given the Book\nflung the very Book of Allah behind their backs,\nas if they knew not full well.",
    "102": "And instead they immersed themselves in what\ngodless fiends had made up and assiduously recounted down through the years\nagainst the sovereign reign of Solomon:\nWhile Solomon did not commit unbelief,\nbut the godless fiends disbelieved:\nThey ceaselessly taught men sorcery and\nwhat was sent down unto the two angels at Babylon,\nHarut and Marut,\nwhile these would never teach a single soul until they had said:\n‘We are but a deadly temptation\nso commit not unbelief!’\nWhereat they would learn from them that by which\nthey would turn a true man against his own beloved wife,\n—while they harm no one at all thereby\nsave by the leave of Allah—\nand they learn what grievously harms them,\nand helps them not the least.\nAnd truly have these at present well understood\nthat whoever eagerly buys it\nshall never in the next world\nhave any share of the good;\nAnd how evil a price indeed\nis what have they sold their souls for,\nif they had only known.",
    "103": "Had they only believed and shown godfearingness,\nthe merest recompense from Allah Himself\nis incomparably better,\nif only they could know.",
    "104": "O you who believe:\ndo not say, ‘Give us time to grasp it,’\nbut rather say, ‘Regard us,’ and hearken;\nAnd the unbelievers who mock your phrase\nin their own Hebrew tongue\nshall have a painful chastisement.",
    "105": "Neither those who disbelieve of the people of the Book, nor the idolaters,\nhave the slightest love for any good\nto be sent down to you all from your Lord;\nWhile Allah favors with His mercy\nwhom He wills;\nAnd Allah is vast of favor.",

    "109": "A great many of the people of the Book\nwould love if only they could turn you back,\neven right after you have accepted faith,\ninto unbelievers again,\nout of jealousy in their own low souls,\njust when they had plainly beheld the truth.\nSo pardon them and pay them no mind,\nuntil Allah brings His final judgement;\nVerily Allah has absolute power\nto do anything.",
    "110": "And keep well the prayer and give the due alms;\nAnd whatever you send ahead of any good for yourselves,\nyou will find well kept in the vast favor of Allah:\nVerily Allah sees everything you do.",
    "111": "And they claim that\nnone shall ever enter the lush grove of paradise,\nbut a full-fledged member of\nJudaism or Christians:\nSuch are their lying vain hopes.\nSay: ‘Bring your clearly decisive proof\nif you are so truthful.’",

    "31": "Those have truly lost themselves in ruin\nwho cry lies to the meeting with Allah,\nuntil when the Final Hour breaks suddenly upon them unawares,\nthey say, ‘O bitter our regret that we utterly neglected it!’\nWhile they bear the burdens of their sins upon their backs;\nAnd how appalling is that they bear!",
    "32": "Nor is the paltry life of this world but a game and frivolity;\nAnd verily the final abode\nis better for those with godfearingness;\nCan you not comprehend?",
    "33": "We well know what they say grieves you;\nYet verily it is not you they cry lies to,\nbut wrongdoers knowingly deny\nthe very signs of Allah.",
    "34": "Truly many great messengers\nin all times before you were cried lies to,\nyet they bore up undaunted\nwith being cried lies to and harmed\nuntil Our victory reached them:\nAnd naught can alter the solemnly promised words of Allah:\nAnd something of the tiding of the messengers has reached you.",

    "36": "None truly respond but those who can hear;\nAnd the spiritually dead Allah shall raise again,\nand woefully direr, to Him shall they be returned.",
    "37": "And they have said: ‘Why has no wondrous sign\nbeen sent down to him from his Lord?’\nSay, ‘Allah is well able to send down any wonder asked for’;\nBut most of them know naught.",
    "38": "For not a single creature is there on earth,\nnor any bird flying on its wings,\nsave they are nations like you:\nNot a single detail have We neglected in the Primal Record;\nThen finally and greater, to their Lord shall they be amassed.",
    "39": "And those who cry lies to Our signs\nare stone deaf and dumb in darknesses:\nWhomever Allah wills, He lets stray,\nand whomever He wills,\nHe places fast upon an exalted straight path.",

    "41": "‘Rather you would call on Him alone,\nand He would lift what you called on Him to, should He will,\nand you forget all that you ascribe to Him as partners.’",
    "42": "Now truly did We send embassage\nto a great many nations in all times before you;\nAnd We seized them with dire want and affliction,\nthat they might humbly plead in prayer.",
    "43": "So why, when Our fury reached them,\nwould they not humbly entreat Us?\nBut their hearts grew all the harder,\nand the Devil decked out fair to them\nwhat they had been committing so long.",
    "44": "So when they had forgotten all\nthey had been reminded with,\nWe loosed unto them the gates of everything,\nuntil when they were exulting in all they had been given,\nWe suddenly took them unawares,\nand lo, they were struck speechless with despair.",
    "45": "So the last remnant\nof the people who did wrong were cut off,\nand all praise be to Allah,\nLord of all Worlds of Beings.",
    "46": "Say: ‘Mind you, did Allah take away your hearing and sight\nand seal up your hearts from knowing anything;\nWho is a god besides Allah to bring you it back?’\nBehold how widely We vary the verses,\nyet stubbornly they turn away.",
    "47": "Say, ‘Mind you, did the\nchastisement of Allah suddenly seize you unawares\nor come on you plain to see;\nWould any be destroyed\nbut the people of the wrongdoers?’",

    "51": "And warn with it those\nwho fear being driven in mass to their Lord\nwithout protector or intercessor short of Him;\nThat haply they may show godfearingness.",
    "52": "And drive not away those who call on their Lord\nat the morning’s rise and wane of day,\nseeking but His countenance.\nYou shall bear nothing of their reckoning,\nand they bear nothing of your reckoning,\nthat you should drive them off,\nso be of the wrongdoers.",
    "53": "Even thus have We gravely tried some of them with others,\nonly for them to say: ‘Is it indeed these\nwhom Allah has supposedly favored\nfrom among us all?’\nWhat, does Allah not know better\nwho the grateful are?",
    "54": "And when those who believe in Our signs come to you,\nsay: ‘All pure secure peace unto you,\nyour Lord has prescribed on Himself mercy;\nThat whoever of you does ill out of folly,\nthen even afterwards\nrepents in time and mends his ways,\nverily He is oft-forgiving,\nall-compassionate.’",
    "55": "Thus ever do We clearly full detail the verses—\nAnd that the path of those who commit crimes\nmay be utterly plain.",
    "56": "Say, ‘Verily I have been forbidden to worship\nthose you call on short of Allah.’\nSay, ‘I obey not your countless wrongheaded fancies,\nfor then I had entirely lost my way,\nnor ever been of the guided.’",
    "57": "Say, ‘I am upon a supreme proof from my Lord,\nwhile you have cried Him lies:\nI possess not what you\nhasten against yourselves with mocking prayers before its time:\nJudgement lies with Allah alone:\nHe recounts the entire Truth\nand He is the best of any who judge and decide.’",
    "58": "Say, ‘Had I with me\nwhat you would hasten against yourselves,\nthe matter had been over between me and you.’\nAnd Allah better knows the wrongdoers.",
    "59": "And His alone are the keys to the unseen,\nunknown to any but Him;\nAnd He knows all on land and sea:\nNor a single leaf falls but He knows it,\nnor a grain lie buried in the darknesses of the earth,\nnor aught fresh or dried,\nbut is in a manifest record.",
    "60": "And it is He who retakes your souls by night,\nand He knows all you are going to commit in the day,\nyet then revives you in it,\nso that an appointed term may be reached;\nThen after all your wakings and final rest, to Him is your last return,\nand yet graver, shall He give you full tidings\nof that which you were doing.",
    "61": "And He is the Irresistibly Powerful over His slaves:\nAnd He sends over you recording angels who see all,\nuntil when death comes to any of you,\nOur envoys bring him back, missing nothing;",

    "63": "Say, ‘Who mightily saves you\nfrom darkest woes on land and sea,\nwhen you humbly beg Him,\nimploring Him aloud and to yourselves:\nShould He save us from this, we shall certainly be of the grateful!’",
    "64": "Say: ‘Allah all-powerfully saves you from them\nand from every dreadful peril;\nYet incredibly, you can still worship others with Him!’",
    "65": "Say, ‘It is He who is well able to loose against you\na devastating chastisement from just above you\nor right beneath your feet,\nor confound you into bitterest factions\nand let you taste the baleful fury of one another’:\nBehold how widely We vary the verses,\nthat haply they may discern.",

    "68": "And when you see those who idly discuss Our verses,\nget up and leave them till they turn to something wholly else.\nAnd should the Devil ever make you forget,\nthen sit no more after remembering\nwith the people of the wrongdoers:",
    "69": "And those who show godfearingness as to such people\nshall bear nothing of their ill-reckoning at all;\nBut need only remind,\nthat haply they too may prove godfearing.",
    "70": "And pay no heed to those\nwho take their religion as an amusement and frivolity,\nand whom the pathetic life of this world has fooled;\nBut remind with this revelation,\nlest any soul be held helplessly fast\nby what it has incurred,\nwith no protector or intercessor short of Allah,\nand should it proffer every ransom,\nnothing of it would be accepted:\nThose are who shall be helplessly held fast\nby what they have incurred:\nTheirs shall be a drink of seething water,\nand an unheard-of painful chastisement\nfor their ceaseless unbelief.",
    "71": "Say: ‘Should we call on, short of Allah,\nwhat neither benefits nor harms us,\nand be thrust back on our heels after Allah has truly guided us:\nLike someone who devils lure astray in the trackless waste,\nlost in bewilderment which way to take,\nwhile he has friends who call him to the right way:\nCome here to us!’\nSay: ‘Verily Allah’s guidance is the sole guidance;\nAnd we have been commanded to surrender\nto the Lord of all Worlds of Beings.’",

    "75": "And just as he saw that, so too We showed Abraham\nthe supreme divine sovereignty\nof the heavens and earth—\nAnd that he might be\nof those utterly certain.",
    "76": "So when night spread over him dark,\nhe beheld a great shining planet;\nHe said, feigning to them for effect: ‘This one is my Lord’;\nSo when it vanished, he said,\n‘I love not those that disappear.’",
    "77": "Then when he saw the moon in plain view,\nhe said: ‘This one is my Lord’;\nSo when it vanished, he said,\n‘Verily if my Lord guide me not,\nI shall truly be of the people of the lost.’",
    "78": "So when he saw the sun in plain view, he declared:\n‘This one is my Lord; this is greater still’;\nSo when it vanished, he said:\n‘My people, I am quit of everything\nyou may worship as partners to Allah:",

    "81": "‘And how should I fear what you ascribe as partners,\nwhen you do not even fear that you have ascribed to Allah\nthat for which He has not sent you down the slightest sovereign proof?\nSo which of the two sides better deserves to feel safe,\nif you have any knowledge?’",
    "82": "Those who believe,\nand never admix their faith with such idolatrous wrong:\nThose shall be forever safe, and they are truly guided.",

    "24": "She was dying for him,\nas he would have been for her, had he not\nseen the sovereign proof of his Lord of its utter vileness:\nEven thus We did, to keep the appalling from him and foul indecency;\nVerily he was of Our servants\nmade purely sincere.",
    "25": "And each of them raced to be first to the door;\nAnd she rent his gown down the back,\nand they suddenly confronted her lord\nat the outer door.\nShe said, ‘No requital is there for\nhim who means ill to your wife\nbut prison, or a painful chastisement.’",
    "26": "He said, ‘She sought to seduce me.’\nAnd a witness from her own family attested:\n‘If his gown has been rent down the front,\nshe has told the truth, and he is\nof the liars.",

    "31": "She no sooner heard of their malicious wiles, than she sent for them,\nand prepared them fine seating to recline and partake from,\nand gave each of them a knife;\nAnd she said, ‘Go out unto them’;\nAnd when they beheld him, they were stunned by him,\nand sliced their hands badly, and said, ‘Nothing is beyond the power of God;\nThis is no mere human being: This is no less than a noble angel!’",
    "32": "She said, ‘That\nis whom you blamed me about:\nAnd truly did I seek to seduce him,\nbut he held out the more:\nNow, if he will not do as I command,\nhe shall surely be imprisoned,\nand be of the helplessly abased.’",
    "33": "He said, ‘My Lord, prison is dearer to me\nthan what they would have me do:\nAnd if You turn not their guile from me,\nI should fall fatuously to their lure,\nand be of the utter fools.’",
    "34": "Then his Lord forthwith truly answered him,\nand turned from him their guile:\nVerily He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.",

    "36": "And two serving-men entered the prison with him.\nOne said, ‘Truly in a dream I saw myself pressing wine.’\nAnd the other said, ‘Truly I saw myself carrying bread on my head\nwhich birds were eating from. Tell us what these portend:\nVerily we see you are of those who\nexcel in every good.’",
    "37": "He said, ‘Food shall not come to the both of you\nas it normally does,\nsave I shall inform you all about it to the last detail\nwell before it even comes to you:\nThat is something of what my Lord has imparted to me,\nbecause I have left the faith of a people who believe not in Allah,\nand of the afterlife they are\nactual deniers.",

    "41": "‘My fellow prisoners:\nAs for the one of you, he shall serve his lord wine;\nAnd as for the other,\nhe shall be bound fast on a stake to die,\nand birds eat from his head:\nThe matter is settled\non which you ask judgement.’",
    "42": "And he told the one he deemed would be saved of them,\n‘Mention me to your master.’\nBut the Devil made the man forget to mention him to his master;\nSo Joseph remained in prison a number of years.",
    "43": "And the king said, ‘I see in a dream\nseven fat cows eaten up by seven ones wasted thin;\nAnd seven verdant ears of grain,\nand seven others withered dry.\nO noble counselors,\ngive me your considered judgement of my vision,\nif you can tell what is meant by dreams.’",
    "44": "They said, ‘Hodgepodge bundles of phantasms;\nNor know we the slightest\nof the portent of empty dreams.’",
    "45": "And the serving-man who was saved of the two,\nand finally managed to remember after the whole long time, said:\n‘It is I who shall bring you word of what it portends,\nso but send me forth.’",
    "46": "‘Joseph, O righteous speaker of truth:\ngive us judgement on\nseven fat cows being eaten by seven ones wasted thin;\nAnd seven green ears of grain,\nand seven others withered dry;\nThat I may return to people,\nthat haply they may know.’",
    "47": "He said, ‘You are to diligently sow for seven hard years,\nand whatever you reap leave in its ear,\nsave for a little of which you eat.",
    "48": "‘Then just after that shall come seven unsparingly dire years\nthat devour all you have put up for them,\nsave a little you keep for seed.",
    "49": "‘Then finally after that shall come an excellent year\nin which men shall be wholly saved,\nand in which they shall press out the very juice and oil.’",
    "50": "The king said, ‘Bring me him at once.’\nBut as soon as the herald reached him, he said,\n‘Return to your lord and ask him\nof the real tidings of the ladies who sliced their hands;\nVerily my Lord well knows\nthe wiles they laid.’",
    "51": "He said, ‘What great thing betided you ladies,\nwhen you seduced Joseph to lead him into sin?’\nThey said, ‘Far be it from God!\nWe know not the slightest ill against him.’\nThe wife of the vizier said, ‘Now is the truth out:\nVerily it was I who sought to seduce him;\nAnd he is of the wholly truthful.’",
    "52": "Joseph told the herald, ‘All of that\nwas so my master might know that I betrayed him not behind his back;\nAnd because Allah guides not the guile\nof the treacherous.",
    "53": "‘Nor do I absolve myself:\nVerily the soul ever bids to ill,\nsave a soul my Lord shows mercy;\nVerily my Lord is all-forgiving, all-compassionate.’",
    "54": "The king said, ‘Bring me him at once,\nthat I have him wholly for myself’;\nSo when he had spoken to him, he said:\n‘This very day shall you be placed high with us in absolute trust.’",
    "55": "He said, ‘Place me over the stores of the land;\nVerily I am a keeper adept.’",
    "56": "Even thus did We establish for Joseph in the land; \nAt home therein wherever he would:\nWe show Our mercy to whomever We will;\nNor waste the wage of those surpassing in good;",
    "57": "And the wage of the next world is far better\nfor those who believe\nand are ever godfearing.",
    "58": "And the brethren of Joseph came\nand entered upon him; And he knew them at once,\nwhile him they knew not.",
    "59": "And when he had laden them with their needed provisions,\nhe said, ‘Bring me a half brother of yours from your father\nfor whom you also drew provisions:\nDo you not well see I replete the full measure,\nand am the best of hosts?",
    "60": "‘So if you produce him not for me,\nyou shall never be measured the more from me,\nnor so much as draw to me near.’",
    "61": "They said, ‘We shall certainly\nentice his father out of him;\nEven thus shall we surely do.’",
    "62": "He said to his serving-men,\n‘Put the things they paid back into their bags,\nso they may recognize them when they get back to their family,\nthat haply they may return.’",
    "63": "So when they returned to their father,\nthey said, ‘Our father: measure is to be denied us;\nSo let our brother come with us,\nthat we may receive full measure,\nwhile we guard him well.’",
    "64": "He said, ‘Shall I entrust him to you\nsave as I trusted his brother to you not but long before?\nBut Allah is far better as Protector,\nand He is the most Merciful of the merciful.’",
    "65": "And when they opened their purchased supplies,\nthey found the things they paid for them had been returned to them.\nThey said, ‘Father, what more could we ask for?\nThese are the very things we paid, returned to us in full;\nAnd we shall get provision from abroad for our whole family,\nand guard well our brother, and so get another whole camel-load:\nThat is a load easy to get.’",
    "66": "He said, ‘Never will I send him with you\ntill you bring me a sworn pledge solemnified from Allah\nthat verily you are all bound to bring him back to me,\nunless you are completely overcome.’\nSo when they had sworn him their solemn pledge,\nhe said, ‘Allah has charge\nover all we say.’",
    "67": "And he was to say:\n‘My sons, enter not by a single gate,\nlest you all be undone together,\nbut enter each from separate gates,\nthough I can avail you nothing from Allah—\nDecision is Allah’s alone;\nOn Him do I rely;\nSo in Him let all who would rely\nplace their trust.’",
    "68": "And when they had entered the city\njust as their father had commanded them,\nit could not avail them the slightest from Allah,\nsave a mere need in Jacob’s heart he had to fulfill;\nFor verily he had tremendous knowledge\nof that We had taught him;\nBoth taking precautions yet certain that nothing can avail from Allah;\nBut most men know it not.",
    "69": "And when they entered upon Joseph,\nhe lodged his brother with himself.\nHe said, ‘Truly I am but your own brother,\nso be not dismayed\nat all they have done.’",
    "70": "So when he had laden them with their provisions,\nhe placed the royal drinking goblet in the lading bag of his brother;\nAnd by and by a herald gave cry:\n‘O journeying caravan: Verily you are thieves!’",
    "71": "They said, turning around and heading back towards them,\n‘What can you be missing?’",
    "72": "They said, ‘We are missing the king’s own goblet;\nAnd whoever produces it shall have a camel-load of grain’;\nThe head of them said: ‘And I personally guarantee it.’",
    "73": "They said, ‘By Allah,\nyou well know that we came not\nto work corruption in the land;\nNor ever could we be thieves!’",
    "74": "They said, ‘Then what shall be the penalty\nfor what has been stolen,\nshould you be liars?’",
    "75": "They said, ‘Its penalty\nis that whoever’s lading bag it is found in\nshall himself be payment for it:\nThus do we ourselves repay wrongdoers.’",
    "76": "So when they returned, he began with their bags before his brother’s,\nthen finally drew it forth from the bag of his brother;\nEven thus did We contrive for Joseph:\nNever could he have taken his brother\nin the laws of the king,\nsave only if Allah had willed:\nWe raise whomever We will innumerable lofty degrees;\nAnd above any who possesses knowledge is\nOne who knows far more.",
    "77": "They said, ‘If he steals,\ntruly a brother of his has already stolen before.’\nAnd Joseph kept it within himself\nand showed them it not;\nHe said to himself: ‘It is you who are viler in place,\nand Allah knows better what you describe.’",
    "78": "They said, ‘O vizier, verily he has a father\nwho is a frail old man;\nSo take one of us in his stead:\nVerily we plainly see you are of those\nwho ever excel in good.’",
    "79": "He said, ‘Allah be my utter refuge\nfrom seizing any but him we found our property with!\nVerily we should then be true wrongdoers.’",
    "80": "So when they despaired of convincing him,\nthey drew apart conversing.\nTheir eldest said,\n‘Do you not realize\nthat your father has taken a solemn pledge upon you from Allah,\nand your heinous negligence no great while before\nin the whole matter of Joseph:\nNever shall I depart this land\ntill my father gives me leave,\nor Allah judges in my favor;\nAnd He is the best of any who judge.",
    "81": "‘Return to your father and say:\nOur father, verily your son has stolen;\nAnd we but attest what we know for a fact;\nnor could we keep our word\non what none of us could foresee.",
    "82": "‘And but ask the city in which we were,\nand the caravan in which we came:\nVerily we speak the truth.’",
    "83": "He said, ‘Rather your hearts have made plausible to you\na heinous thing;\nSo mine is patient grace:\nHaply Allah shall bring them all to me;\nVerily only He is the All-knowing,\nthe All-wise.’",
    "84": "And he turned from them and said,\n‘O my searing grief for Joseph!’\nAnd his eyes grew white for very sorrow,\nchoking back his grief.",
    "85": "They said, ‘By Allah,\never will you burn\nremembering Joseph,\ntill you are worn away to naught,\nor of those who outright die!’",
    "86": "He said, ‘I but complain my ungovernable anguish\nand sorrow to Allah;\nAnd I know of Allah what you know not.",
    "87": "‘My sons, go and search everywhere\nfor Joseph and his brother;\nAnd despair not of the utter relief of Allah:\nVerily none despairs of the utter relief of Allah\nbut the people of the unbelievers.’",
    "88": "So when they entered upon Joseph,\nthey said, ‘O mighty vizier:\nAffliction has touched us dire and our whole family,\nand we have brought but miserable merchandise;\nSo replete us in gracious measure\nand show charity to us:\nVerily Allah magnificently repays\nthe charitable.’",
    "89": "He said, ‘Do you realize\nwhat you did to Joseph and his brother\nwhen you were fools?’",
    "90": "They said, ‘Can you be Joseph?’\nHe said, ‘I am Joseph, and this is my brother;\nAllah has bestowed His blessing beyond thanks upon us:\nVerily whoever is godfearing and patient,\nAllah never wastes the wage\nof those who excel in good.’",
    "91": "They said, ‘By Allah;\nAllah has truly preferred you above us in every way,\nwhile verily we were of the grievously wrong.’",
    "92": "He said, ‘No blame shall disgrace you, even today:\nMay Allah forgive you,\nand He is the most Merciful\nof the merciful.",
    "93": "‘Take this gown of mine\nand cast it on the face of my father,\nand he will come at once,\nrestored in sight;\nAnd straightway bring me all your families together.’",
    "94": "And as the caravan left that land,\ntheir father said: ‘Verily I find the scent of Joseph,\nwere you not to deem me witless with age.’",
    "95": "They said, ‘By Allah,\nyou are truly still in your\nsame old error.’",
    "96": "And when the bearer of the glad tidings came,\nhe cast it on his face,\nand he regained his sight.\nHe said, ‘Did I not tell you all\nthat I know of Allah what you know not?’",
    "97": "They said, ‘O father, ask forgiveness of our sins;\nVerily we were great wrongdoers.’",
    "98": "He said, ‘I shall indeed ask my Lord to forgive you;\nTruly He alone is the All-forgiving,\nthe All-compassionate.’",
    "99": "So when they entered upon Joseph,\nhe drew his parents to himself in full honor,\nand said, ‘Enter Egypt by the leave of Allah wholly secure.’",
    "100": "And he raised his parents upon the dais,\nand all had fallen down prostrate before him, and he said,\n‘My dear father, this is what my dream foretold not overly long ago:\nMy Lord has made it come true\nand shown me every kindness\nwhen He released me from the prison\nand brought all of you here from the open plains,\neven after the Devil spurred up malice between me and my brothers;\nVerily my Lord is subtly gentle\nin effecting aught He wills:\nTruly He alone is the All-knowing,\nthe All-wise.",
    "101": "‘My Lord, You have endowed me of sovereignty,\nand taught me of what dreams portend;\nOriginator of the heavens and earth:\nYou are my ever-powerful Friend and Protector\nin this world and the next;\nTake back my soul in whole submission to You as a Muslim,\nand put me among the supremely righteous.’",
    "102": "Those are of the tidings of the unseen,\nWe inspiring them to you;\nYou were not present with them\nwhen they concerted to do ill,\nlaying their wiles.",
    "103": "And most men,\nno matter how keen you be,\nare not believers.",

    "106": "Nor do most of them believe in Allah\nsave while ascribing partners\nto Him in worship.",
    "107": "Feel they safe lest\na dire calamity reach them\nof the chastisement of Allah;\nOr the Final Hour suddenly break upon them\nunawares?",
    "108": "Say, ‘This is my path:\nI summon to Allah upon the full light of insight,\nI and whoever truly follows me,\nAnd how gloriously is Allah exalted;\nNor ever could I be\nof those who worship anything with Him.’",
    "109": "And never did We send before you\nanything but men whom We inspired, of the dwellers of towns.\nHave they not journeyed in the earth and just looked\nhow was the end of those but not long before them?\nAnd the abode of the next world is better\nfor those of godfearingness;\nCan you not even think?",
    "110": "Until, when Our messengers gave over\nand thought they might be left unaided,\nOur triumph reached them.\nSo those We willed were saved;\nAnd Our bale is unrepelled\nfrom a people who wreak crimes.",
    "111": "Verily in the full account of them\nis a mighty reflection for those of insight and mind.\nNor could it be mere tidings forged;\nBut rather the confirming of what came before it,\nand a detailing of everything needed,\nand a mighty guidance and mercy\nfor a people who believe.",

    "56": "Truly you cannot guide just anyone you would love to;\nBut Allah alone guides whom He wills; \nAnd He knows better who can be guided.",
    "57": "And they have said,\n‘If we follow the guidance with you,\nwe would be pounced on and picked off our very lands.’\n—Yet have We not established for them a sanctuary secure from peril,\nto which ample choice fruits and produce of every kind are gathered,\nin mighty providence from Our very Self?\nBut most of them know naught.",
